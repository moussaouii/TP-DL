# TP-DL
Basic implementations of Deep Learning algorithms via the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) package ([Python](https://www.python.org/)). 

## Getting Started
Every folder refers to a laboratory project:
* TP1: The goal of this laboratory project is to implement a classification task on the images of the game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' with a fully-connected forward neural networks model and with a convolution neural network model
* TP2: The goal of this  is to classify the images from MNIST dataset  using a auto-encoder algorithm and a variational auto-encoder implemented with the Python package Torch.
* TP3: The goal of this laboratory project is to introduced  the recurrent neural network. The work support is the prediction of a mathematical function sin t


### Prerequisites
First, You should install Anaconda or Miniconda and jupyter
after that, you should install pythorch package.

```
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
conda install pytorchvision
conda install -c pytorch torchvision
```
you should also install some others packages like : pandas, matplotlib
